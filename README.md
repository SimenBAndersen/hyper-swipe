# hyper-swipe
Drag and drop Single Page Application made using React
- Cards are dragged/swiped into a box of either "like" or "dislike"
- Data about the cards and whether it was "liked" or "disliked" is stored in local storage

Using the following solutions/technology:
- React Drag and Drop(https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/) higher order components to drag and drop cards into boxes of "like" and "dislike". 
- https://hyper-swipe.herokuapp.com/cards for cards-data (I copied the data into a separate/local file due to some errors when retrieving the data from its original place)
- Create-react-app

Styling:
- Google Fonts, Nunito (normal, extra bold and light)
- Not responsive, but should look ok on most laptop/computer screens (1024px and above)
